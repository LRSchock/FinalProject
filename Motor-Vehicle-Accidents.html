    <div class="article">
      <p>Accidents on roads injure thousands of people every day. Whether you are driving a car, or are a passenger, pedestrian, bicycle/motorcycle rider, you are dependent on the actions of every other driver around you. Far too often, innocent drivers, pedestrians and bicyclists are seriously injured in an accident involving the negligent operation of a car, automobile, truck, private or city bus, taxi or coach, subway or train.</p>

      <p>Some of the common causes of motor vehicles accidents, including drunk-driving accidents and distracted driving accidents. </p>

      <h5>Drunk Driving Accidents</h5>

      <p>Every year, drunk-driving accidents take thousands of lives and many more innocent victims are injured.  In addition to holding responsible drivers responsible for their negligence, these accidents often result from restaurants, bars and hosts of private parties failing to take responsibility for a driver who may have become intoxicated at their establishment or premises. When this is the case, the owner of the restaurant or bar or the owner of the property where the party occurred may be held liable for the injuries caused by that drunk driver under what are called dram shop laws.</p>

      <h5>Distracted Driving Accidents</h5>

      <p>Distracted driving is a major cause of motor vehicle injuries and deaths., almost all of which could have been avoided if drivers had made more responsible decisions behind the wheel.  Cell phone use, including voice calls and text messaging are a major cause, when combined with inexperience, especially among young drivers, the results can be catastrophic.
      Common Motor Vehicle Accident Injuries</p>

      <p>All too often, the drivers and operators of these types of vehicles make mistakes that have an immediate impact on your health and well-being.  Their negligence results in money lost from work, days or weeks lost from school and an overall decrease in your quality of life.  Many accidents also result in significant physical injuries, including:</p>

        <ul class="bodylist">
          <li class="bodylist">Broken bones</li>
          <li class="bodylist">Fractures</li>
          <li class="bodylist">Permanent scars</li>
          <li class="bodylist">Burns</li>
          <li class="bodylist">Spinal injuries</li>
          <li class="bodylist">Neck and back injuries, including herniated disks and paralysis</li>
          <li class="bodylist">Psychological damages</li>
          <li class="bodylist">Wrongful death</li>
        </ul><br>

      <p>In the event your loved one is killed in a fatal accident, you may be able to recover:</p>

      <ul class="bodylist">
          <li class="bodylist">Lost wages that the accident victim would have earned during remaining working years. </li>
          <li class="bodylist">Medical expenses</li>
          <li class="bodylist">	Pain and suffering — Many victims do not die instantly, and compensation is due for their pain and suffering prior to death.</li>
          <li class="bodylist">	Loss of consortium — A spouse is entitled to loss of marital relations that would have been enjoyed or loss of parental relationship (love and affection) if the victim was a parent.</li>
      </ul>


      <h5>Dealing with Insurance Companies: No-Fault, Underinsurance and “Hit and Runs”</h5>

      <p>Fortunately, whenever vehicles of any kind are involved in an accident, your medical bills, lost earnings, property damage and personal injuries are often covered by insurance.  This is true even when the vehicles themselves have no insurance at all or are operated by unidentified “hit and run” drivers!   Since vehicle accidents are very common, there maybe means for a greater recovery even when the vehicle itself has very low insurance or no known insurance coverage at all.  In these types of situations, special filing rules apply that are best handled by experienced personal injury attorneys like Ross, Legan, Rosenberg, Zelen & Flaks, LLP.</p>

      <p>For example, in accidents involving unidentified “hit and run” vehicles, Police Reports must be filed within 24 hours and notarized Uninsurance Claim Forms must be filed within 30 days of the accident occurrence.  Additional notarized claim forms must be filed within 90 days whenever City and most other government owned vehicles are involved in an accident.  In most other accidents, even where the operators and insurers are known, medical and lost wage “No Fault” Insurance Claim Forms must also be filed within 30 days of the accident.  Furthermore, special notarized Underinsurance Claim Forms often must be filed with the proper insurer “as soon as reasonably practicable.”  The courts also have deadlines that need to be adhered to in order to avoid an accident case being dismissed.  These rules and regulations can be quite confusing to someone not familiar with them, particularly after being involved in an accident.</p>

      <h5>Contact an Experienced Auto Accident Lawyer</h5>

      <p>With so much to do in putting your life together again after an accident, and so much at stake in meeting all these filing deadlines, you truly can benefit from a free and immediate telephone or personal consultation with experienced personal injury accident attorneys.  Many times, innocent accident victims hurt their case by speaking to the insurance company before contacting an experienced accident attorney.   At Ross, Legan, Rosenberg, Zelen & Flaks, LLP we are very familiar with both the legal and the insurance issues involved in your case.  Our law firm is well aware of the deadlines and filing requirements. </p>
